## Running

This is a newbie guide to run your own instance, incase mine gets overcrowded.

1. Create a python repl on [Replit.com](https://replit.com).
2. Copypaste the `src` folder and `main.py` file into your replit.
3. Overwrite the `replit.nix` file with this repo's file.
    - You need to toggle on "Show Hidden Files" to see it.
4. Refresh the website, then click run.

Your base URL should look like this `https://<replname>.<username>.repl.co`.
